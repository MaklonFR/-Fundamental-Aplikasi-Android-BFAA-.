# Fundamental-Aplikasi-Android-BFAA (Don't Copy and Paste)


Anyone who has reached school age should know that copying someone elseâ€™s work and claiming it as their own is wrong. In writing, this is called copy paste plagiarism and it is, unfortunately, becoming more commonplace as the information age progresses. Students have access to a glut of already-written articles on the internet. Through either a lack of understanding about copyright rules or plain laziness, more people use copy paste plagiarism as a way to get content fast. (https://www.plagramme.com/)


Finish project  Fundamental Aplikasi Android (BFAA) Using Kotlin

I created this repo as a reference material for the Android Application Fundamental Learning Coding Class (BFAA) so that I can help my friends in completing the Class Exercises and Submissions that are being worked on. Remember not to just copy-paste without understanding the programming scheme. Spirit. Greetings Coding for Happy
